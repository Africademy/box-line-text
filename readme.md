Box Box Line
============

![Basic demo](media/demo.gif)

Box Box Line is a simple virtual whiteboarding tool. The existing tools were all too noisey or too complicated for me, so I built my own to meet my needs. Perhaps it meets yours as well.

Overview
--------

This tool generally assumes that you are screencasting from a laptop or desktop. It doesn't provide touch or pen support. There are much better tools available for that type of interface.

Usage
-----

- Click and drag to draw boxes
- Click anywhere to create a new text element
- Lines are just flat boxes
- Ctrl-Z undoes previous actions

FAQ
---

### How do I save?

There's no "feature" for this. In most browsers, you can save the page as an HTML file. This should save your diagram and allow you to pick up where you left off. Screenshots are also an option.

### How do I start over?

Right now, you can either mash Ctrl-Z or refresh the page (probably F5).

### How do I export to SVG?

That would be nice, wouldn't it?
