Box Box Line
============

![Basic demo](media/demo.gif)

Box Box Line is a simple virtual whiteboarding tool. The existing tools were all too noisey or too complicated for me, so I built my own to meet my needs. Perhaps it meets yours as well.

Overview
--------

This tool generally assumes that you are screencasting from a laptop or desktop. It doesn't provide touch or pen support. There are much better tools available for that type of interface.

Usage
-----

- Click and drag to draw boxes
- Click anywhere to create a new text element
- Lines are just flat boxes
- Ctrl-Z undoes previous actions
